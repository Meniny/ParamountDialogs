#  No more shall we pray for peace
#  Never ever ask them why
#  No more shall we stop their visions
#  Of selfdestructing genocide
#  Dogs on leads march to war
#  Go ahead end it all...
#
#  Blow up the world
#  The final silence
#  Blow up the world
#  I don't give a damn!
#
#  Screams of terror, panic spreads
#  Bombs are raining from the sky
#  Bodies burning, all is dead
#  There's no place left to hide
#  Dogs on leads march to war
#  Go ahead end it all...
#
#  Blow up the world
#  The final silence
#  Blow up the world
#  I don't give a damn!
#
#  (A voice was heard from the battle field)
#
#  "Couldn't care less for a last goodbye
#  For as I die, so do all my enemies
#  There's no tomorrow, and no more today
#  So let us all fade away..."
#
#  Upon this ball of dirt we lived
#  Darkened clouds now to dwell
#  Wasted years of man's creation
#  The final silence now can tell
#  Dogs on leads march to war
#  Go ahead end it all...
#
#  Blow up the world
#  The final silence
#  Blow up the world
#  I don't give a damn!
#
#  When I wrote this code, only I and God knew what it was.
#  Now, only God knows!
#
#  So if you're done trying 'optimize' this routine (and failed),
#  please increment the following counter
#  as a warning to the next guy:
#
#  total_hours_wasted_here = 0
